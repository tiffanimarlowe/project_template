### Pitch

1.What is the topic?

The topic is dealing with the issue of delivering consumer goods in our target city Orlando

2.What do you want to do?

We want to model a part of the city of Orlando and simulate the differences between ground based (trucks) and air based (drones) delivery methods. Our main effort is the air based delivery method in regards to speed of delivery, efficiency and overall effort of the system (quantity of drones, quantity and location of hubs).

3.Why is important?

Current consumer behaviors indicates the active buying patterns are becoming more decentralized (ordering online) and we want to see if the concept of delivery is valid and how we can integrate this into the exisiting infracture.
