# Code Folder 

Your code (project files) goes here. You could also replace the content of this file with something more meaningful


## The used file/code for AnyLogic is the folder "Final Project".

- the other 2 folders (AMADRONE_state and Project_AmaDrone) were attempts which were not leading in the right direction. They are left inside the folder structure simply for documentation purposes.
